- **JavaScript**: For backend form submission to ensure functionality and email notifications.

## Personal Learnings

While working on this project, I revisited and found several concepts interesting and important:

- **Label**: It is crucial for accessibility and enhances the user experience (UX).
- **Name Attribute**: Essential for creating key/value pairs for backend processing.
- **Fieldset and Legend**: Refreshed my understanding of grouping form elements.
- **Input Attributes**: Reviewed various input attributes and their usage.
- **Element Connections**: Gained a deeper understanding of how elements like `label`, `input`, `select`, and `option` connect and work together.

### CSS Insights

Although this wasn't primarily a CSS exercise, I learned a lot about the flex property. Specifically:

- The importance of using `.wrapper > *` to set flex properties for child elements.
- Understanding that setting flex properties for both parent and children (form and aside) ensures smooth responsiveness.
- Realizing that without this, the layout wouldn't be as responsive as intended.
